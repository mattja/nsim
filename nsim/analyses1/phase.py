"""
Various analyses that apply to the phase time-series of an oscillator 

functions:
"""

import numpy as np


def mod2pi(ts):
    """For a timeseries where all variables represent phases (in radians),
    return an equivalent timeseries where all values are in the range (-pi, pi]
    """
    return np.pi - np.mod(np.pi - ts, 2*np.pi)


def phase_crossings(ts, phi=0.0):
    """For a single variable timeseries representing the phase of an oscillator,
    find the times at which the phase crosses angle phi,
    with the condition that the phase must visit phi+pi between crossings.

    (Thus if noise causes the phase to wander back and forth across angle phi 
    without the oscillator doing a full revolution, then this is recorded as 
    a single crossing event, giving the time of the earliest arrival.)

    If the timeseries begins (or ends) exactly at phi, then time zero 
    (or the ending time) is also included as a crossing event, 
    so that the boundaries of the first and last oscillations are included.

    If the actual crossing time falls between two time steps, linear
    interpolation is used to estimate the crossing time.

    Arguments:
      ts: Timeseries (single variable)
          The timeseries of an angle variable (radians)

      phi (float): Critical phase angle (radians) at which to report crossings.
